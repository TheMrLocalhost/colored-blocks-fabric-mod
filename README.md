![0.0.3 screenshot](/showcase/0.0.3_blocks_preview.jpg)

This mod adds custom blocks with 16 color choices.

Makes stone bricks and birch planks colorable and adds the ability to color various other blocks that already have color variations.

Using the three primary components of this mod you can color, clean, and recolor blocks in Minecraft.

- ***Artist Palette***
  - Held in the off hand slot.
  - Damage displayed is the charges remaining.
  - Hover over item to show "dye" actions remaining.
  - Item has different states for 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% dye remaining.
  - Right click any dye in main hand with palette in off hand to charge (8 charges per dye).

- ***Paintbrush***
  - Held in the main hand.
  - Paintbrush tip shows color picked.
  - Shfit right click to cycle color chosen (hold to cycle faster).
  - right click on a block to color it.

- ***Cleaning Cloth***
  - Held in the main hand.
  - Right click colored blocks in the world to "clean" them.
  - If a block doesn't have a "clean" version, it will change to the white variant of the block.
  
 ## TODO
 
 Add rotary dial that displays when shift is held with the paintbrush in the main hand.
 
 This would assist in more precise color picking and remove frustration of accidentally passing the desired color.
